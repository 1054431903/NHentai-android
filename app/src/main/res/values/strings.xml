    <string name="text_placeholder">"Available now!\n\nThe Design library is available now, so make sure to update the Android Support Repository in the SDK Manager. You can then start using the Design library
with a single new dependency:\ncompile \'com.android.support:design:22.2.0\'
\nNote that as the Design library depends on the Support v4 and AppCompat Support Libraries, those will be included automatically when you add the Design
library dependency. We also took care that these new widgets are usable in the Android Studio Layout Editor\â€™s Design view (find them under CustomView),
giving you an easier way to preview some of these new components.
The Design library, AppCompat, and all of the Android Support Library are important tools in providing the building blocks needed to build a modern, great
looking Android app without building everything from scratch."</string>
